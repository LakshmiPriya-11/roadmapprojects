# RoadMap Projects

This repository contains a series of frontend projects I'm building while following the [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) to strengthen my frontend development skills.

Each project focuses on a specific concept or technology in the frontend roadmap â€” starting from the basics of HTML/CSS to JavaScript, APIs, frameworks, and more.
